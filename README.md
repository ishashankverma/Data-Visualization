Summary - The visualization shows the survival factors for the individuals aboard the Titanic on the day of disaster. It shows the affect of various factors such as Age, Passenger Class, Gender and Passenger embarked port on the survival of the passengers. 

Design - I will use bar charts to visualize the survival rates of the passengers based on age, class, gender and embarked. I decided to remove the NaN values, as they were misleading to the audience. I changed the color of the bars to green (survived) and red (died) to make it easier for the audience's perception. Added the count for the bars. Decided to add actual numbers of passenger survival/death to give a clear picture. 

Feedback - 
Feedback 1
Visual data has been properly formatted against various valued, tyoe, gender, class etc. 
The number of people rescued is biased? More for class 1 and less for class 3?
More number of males died during rescue operation, considering that they sacrificed saving females.
More priority was given to children during the rescue operations.
The visualizations would look better if the grid lines were removed.

Feedback 2

Segregation of statistics on the basis of gender,class and age helps in better interpretation of the impact on lives lost due to sinking of the Titanic.
The NaNs are misleading, and it says 100% of the NaNs survived. Is there any count ? Using the actual numbers of deaths and survivals would give a clear picture of the scenario.

Feedback 3
Data visualization on the class, gender and embarked ports look good. It would help to plot the ages without the NaN values. The visualization can be improved by using red or green color to mark survived and dead.
